              My name is Marina Delneri and I am currently a student of coding
              and web development. I am based in Minneapolis, MN, United States,
              but I am originally from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and have lived in many
              places around the world. My initial draw to coding came from my
              life-long love of math, logic, languages, and learning, as well as
              a desire to add to and expand on my current talents. Additionally,
              I have always been interested in skills that can translate to
              anywhere in the world.
            </p>

              Although I have yet to gain more experience in this field, I find
              myself challenged and invigorated by the material I have learned
              so far. I realize that the study of coding and web development is
              never-ending, and I look forward to always going after more
              material to expand my knowledge on the subject.
            </p>

            <p>
              My coding skills are so far centered around the HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Moment.js, and Node Js
              technologies. I will continue to add to and diversify my skills,
              as well as add more material to my portfolio. I hope to be able to
              utilize these skills in a work environment in the near future, and
              eventually bring them to an industry that I am passionate about,
              which includes hospitality, the arts/music, travel, and the field
              of renewable resources.
